<h1>Buyucoin - Easiest way to buy bitcoin online in India </h1>
					<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
					
				</header>
				<div class="container">
					<section>
						<h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF USE</h2>
						
						<p>By using this Site, and further by registering to use our Service, you ("You, Your or Yourself") are agreeing to accept and comply with the terms and conditions of use stated below ("Terms of Use"). You should read the entire Terms of Use carefully before you use this web site ("Site") or any of the services of this Site.

The Service allows buyers ("Buyers") and sellers ("Sellers"), to buy and sell the Internet currency known as "Bitcoins" (see http://bitcoin.org).

The Service allows all registered users of the Service ("Members") to:

    Purchase digital currencies.

Depending on Your country of residence, You may not be able to use all the functions of the Site. It is your responsibility to follow those rules and laws in Your country of residence and/or country from which You access this Site and Services.</p>
<h2>
IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE AND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.</h2>
						<p>By opening an account to use the Service ("Account"), You expressly represent and warrant:

    1. You have accepted these Terms; and
    2. You are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms and enter into a transaction involving Bitcoins.
</p>
<h2> RISKS</h2>
<p> The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.

Bitcoin trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Bitcoin is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency.

Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.

Bitcoin trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.

There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.

You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoins.

We use our banking providers in order to receive client moneys and making payments. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer Bitcoins, exchange Bitcoins, or provide any services in connection with Bitcoins.

WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY PROFIT FROM TRADING OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEBSITE.</p>

<h2>
LIMITED ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING ("AML") AND COUNTER TERRORIST FINANCING ("CTF") POLICY</h2>

<p>Money laundering is defined as the process where the identity of the proceeds of crime are so disguised that it gives the appearance of legitimate income. Criminals specifically target financial services firms through which they attempt to launder criminal proceeds without the firm's knowledge or suspicions.

We are currently unregulated and do not fall with the scope of the AML obligations, the senior management have implemented systems and procedures that meet the AML legislation. This decision reflects the senior managements desire to prevent money laundering and not be used by criminals to launder proceeds if crime.</p>
