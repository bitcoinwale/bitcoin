<p>Bitcoin, the most volatile currency I had ever seen. It has the capability to change anyone's future with its volatile nature. It is young currency as compared to any other currency in the world. It was started in year 2009 as the first digital currency in the world. Because of its volatile nature and quick change in its price it became choice of every investor since then, people started investing in it. This will seem fake to you but it's a truth. Everyone will question on this but this had happened because of bitcoin volatile nature.</p>

<p>It was the time of January 2011 when my one of friend buy Bitcoins worth 5000 rupees, at that time bitcoin cost Rs 20/bitcoin so he got 250 Bitcoins. Since his investment the price started to rise, in the second week of June 2011 the price reached Rs 2100/bitcoin. But unfortunately, the price didn't remain at that position for a long time and hence at the end of 2011 price got a downfall and reached Rs 300/bitcoin. </p>

<p><b>Steady increase in price in 2012</b></p>

<p>At the starting of 2012 prices bumped to Rs 340/bitcoin. But there was little downfall in its price but till the end of 2012 price increased well and reaches at rate of Rs 890/bitcoin. With this price my friend investment of Rs 5000 has turned in Rs 2,22,500. </p>

<p><b>All time high price in 2013</b></p>

<p>In this year bitcoin had seen its highest price of all time. But unlike previous years this year its price starts with a little dip i.e. Rs 870/bitcoin. It was the most happening year in the history of bitcoin as On March 18, 2013, the <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html" target="_blank">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN) issued guidelines for individuals using bitcoin in the United States, causing problems for many bitcoin exchanges. The attacks by hackers on several bitcoin exchanges and the FBI seizure of more than 170,000 bitcoins from criminal online portal Silk Road caused the market price to go up and down. But when Chinese media started promoting bitcoins and baidu, a Chinese web services company started to accept bitcoins as payment its prices hit all-time high over Rs 76000/bitcoin. </p>

<p>Everyone was mesmerized with this but my friend sold his 250 bitcoins when its price were approximately Rs 50100/bitcoin. That made his 5 thousand into 1.25crore .</p>

<p>This price rise was after first halving and second halving is about to take place. And if history repeats then you can also earn a good amount from bitcoins. Don't wait start your investment journey today. </p>
