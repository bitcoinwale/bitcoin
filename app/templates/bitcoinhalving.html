<p>Bitcoin, the digital currency, have been bringing a revolutionary change since 2009, invented by Satoshi, it has become a powerful weapon in payment system in such fast developing world. The use of Bitcoin has increased rapidly over years. It is the very first cryptocurrency that has been decentralised i.e., there is no mediator in the transaction system. Moreover no particular body has the complete control over the transaction system, this in turn, eradicates the chances of fraud. It is completely under people, the transactions take place directly between users. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain.</p>
<p>Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. Bitcoin mining can be done by anyone just the requirements are running software with specialized hardware.</p>
<p>The inventor of Bitcoin made a policy while introducing this magic currency that only and only 21 Million bitcoins will ever be created and a fixed amount of coins will be created after every 10 minutes (approximately) when 1 block get mined . Also, this reward amount will be halved roughly after every 4 years. This was later called the halving event.</p>
<p>Till now, only a single halving event has taken place which was in November 2012 which lead the reward on mining amount from 50 to 25 bitcoins per block. This halving event witnessed something really unusual, before roughly 10 days of halving the value of bitcoins became constant, but just after 15 days of halving the value reached all-time high in bitcoin history. This halving event provided unimaginable profits to the people who invested in bitcoins.</p>
<p>As per the predictions, the next halving event will take place near July 10, 2016 in which reward amount will decrease from 25 to 12.5 bitcoin per block. A lot could happen to bitcoin price after halving in july. The experts say the results this time are going to be massive and will be giving a very high rise to the use of bitcoins. The price of bitcoins has become constant nowadays; it is quite similar to what happened four years ago. The history is repeating itself and this time the rise may be such huge that couldn't be imagined. Actually it's quite simple economics, if the supply rate of something decreases in market it automatically increases its price in market, the similar is predicted by experts. The experts also say this is the golden time to invest in Bitcoins, because this is the peak time when halving is just about to take place. The peak time investment earns an unpredictable extreme profit. <br /> Read<a href="bitinvest.html"> How my friend earned 1.25crore from bitcoins?</a></p>
<p>Bitcoin being a very young currency with much room to grow in use and value, I would personally bet on a price increase. How much? When? It remains 100% unpredictable....</p>
